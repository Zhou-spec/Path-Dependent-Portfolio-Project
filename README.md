# Path-Dependent-Portfolio-Project
This is the repo for the path-dependent portfolio optimization project. Here, I extend the idea used in the entropy-regularized portfolio optimization project and extend to the path-dependent version of it. Solving the path-dependent PDE faced in this project is 
not easy, and I use LSTM to help me approximate the path-dependent PDE's solution.
